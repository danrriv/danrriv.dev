        "content2": "I entered the tech world almost by accident, my initial plan was to study psychology, but I ended up surprising myself by genuinely enjoying the process of building applications from scratch, solving problems, and turning ideas into something real… even staying up late because of a bug.",
        "content3": "I'm especially interested in growing as a backend developer. I’m motivated by learning new things and taking on challenges that push my knowledge further. Every time I research something, I realize there’s an entire universe of topics to explore. It can be overwhelming, sure, but I think that’s the beauty of this career: it changes, evolves, and forces you to grow with it. It also teaches you patience… because, wow, you really need it.",
        "content4": "Outside of work, I’m a calm person — I think a lot, laugh easily, and enjoy those curious coincidences life likes to throw my way."
